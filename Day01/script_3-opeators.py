"""Operators perform operations on variables and values.
    Common types of operators:
    - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
    - Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    - Logical Operators: and, or, not
    - Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
    Syntax:
        result = a + b
